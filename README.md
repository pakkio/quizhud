Quizhud (Educational tool for Second Life/OpenSim) starting from http://quizhud.avid-insight.co.uk/

Need to branch this to have a version without HTML to be used in OpenSim for browser not capable of multimedia.

This branch contains everything needed to be able to use quizhud without multimedia

Differences essentially are in the following:

* HUD is having a board script able to display llSetText on some small prims so HUD is a bit more complex
* some modifications in php scripts to change text removing all extra html
*
